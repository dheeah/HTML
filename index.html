<p>During my childhood, I started my studies at a private school, Fondation Bouebdelli, I studied there for 6 years then I moved to a new high-school back then, Esprit in which I spent 3 years. 
    Finally I spent my last years right before university at ECT, l'école canadienne de tunis, in which I got my baccalaureate degree. 
    However, later on, I spent 5 years in Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying several stuff related to the high-tech used nowadays and other subjects such as coding.
All the info needed such as my marks will be provided right in the Marks category. </p>
